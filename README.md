# Voice-Desktop-Assistant
My project topic is "Voice Desktop Assistant". It is somehow similar to Google assistant, Siri. It is basically taking our voice as input and perform the given command. It helps the user to perform basic operations on their computer such as; opening programs, checking the time, checking the disk space, checking the battery.
